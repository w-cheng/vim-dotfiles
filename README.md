vim-dotfiles
============

My .vim files. Nothing fancy, just some basic things I use. Since I don't update my plugins very often, I'm not bothered with tracking them as ubmodules.

Assume you are using Ubuntu:

* Syntastic requires pyflakes installed. 
	To install: $ sudo apt-get install -y pyflakes

* Tagbar requires Exuberant CTags installed.
	To install: $ sudo apt-get install -y exuberant-ctags

* Clang requires clang installed.
	To install: $ sudo apt-get install -y clang

* Jedi-vim requires jedi installed.
	To install: $sudo pip install jedi
